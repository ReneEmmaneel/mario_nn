TODO:

Options for in the form itself:

-weighted sampled checkboxes
-weights for above training objectives
-percentage deterministic (value between 0-100) (use rng instead of every other x times)
-dropdown list for which savestate to use




PROBLEMS:
-Dataloading time is insane -> make it waaaay faster by not loading it every time
-Furthermore, more epochs per dataloading
